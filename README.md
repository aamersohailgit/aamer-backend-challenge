## Aamer Technical Challenge

- The solution is built using Django and Graphql, and I have included a requirements.txt file for your reference. The solution is designed to work with Python version 3.11.1. The service has been exposed as a GraphQL endpoint at /graphql.

- The GraphQL schema includes a single query, "person," which returns a Person object. In addition to this, I have also added Create, Update, and Delete APIs to populate the database with some data. All of the required fields for Person and Address models have been included in the schema.

- I have also taken care of validations, such as ensuring that the state field is an Enum value, as per the requirements. The Person and Address models have been linked in the schema design.

- I hope you will find my efforts satisfactory and would give a positive feedback.
